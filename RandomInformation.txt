If we want to turn out JS code to older versions for compatibility
reassons there is this site https://babeljs.io/.

Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

Method refers to a function inside an Object.

const obj={"one" :1,"two":2}//You can change values but not assigh 
the object value

const array=[1,2,3,4,5];//you can reassign but not redeclare
 the array value.

TIP:const indicates that it should not change.

Object is the a combination of variables, functions(refered as methods)
, and data structures.
